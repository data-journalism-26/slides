# Why study data journalism beyond the West?

.pull-left[
## The problem

- Most data journalism research focuses on Western newsrooms
- Different contexts create different challenges and opportunities
- Innovation often happens at the periphery

## Mutsvairo, Bebawi &amp; Borges-Rey (2020)

- How data journalism develops in non-Western contexts
- The role of infrastructure, politics, and resources
- Alternative models and innovations

# Case study: La Nación Data (Argentina)

.pull-left-wide2[
## La Nación Data

**Founded:** 2012 within Argentina's leading newspaper | **Model:** Pioneered data-supported investigative journalism in Latin America

## The Corruption Notebooks (2018)

**What they got:** Handwritten notebooks from the driver of Roberto Baratta, Secretary under the Kirchner administrations (2003-2015). The notebooks documented every bribe delivery route for a decade.

**The investigation:** Team spent 7 months digitizing 8 notebooks before going public; cross-checked all payments against tenders and public contracts; built network visualizations showing web of corruption

**The impact:** 73 people prosecuted, including fmr. President Cristina Kirchner, 40 imprisoned, 40 confessed, $600 million seized

# Case study: Caixin (China)

.pull-left-wide2[
## Caixin Media

**Founded:** 2009 by editor-in-chief Hu Shuli | **VisLab:** Established 2013 by Zhimin Huang ("first person to do data journalism in China") | **Awards:** 2018 GEN Award for Best Large Data Journalism Team (first Chinese outlet)

## Zhou Yongkang case (2014)

**The challenge:** Zhou was former head of China's security services, being investigated for corruption; Caixin wrote 60,000-word investigative story but worried "people might get tired reading"

**The solution:** Created network visualization showing Zhou's web of power; mapped connections between officials and companies;

**Impact:** 4 million hits within one week, 20 million social media views; "considered a turning point in Chinese journalism"; created appetite for visual stories that didn't exist before

# What Western journalism can learn

.pull-left-wide[
## Beyond the technology hype

Data and open source investigative journalism in the Global South reveals that **data-informed journalism is not necessarily about sophisticated tools**, but about:

- Working with limited resources creatively
- Capitalizing on communities and networks
- Adapting to local contexts and constraints

## Alternative models of practice

**Civic tech collaboration:** In many contexts, civic organizations do the data work that traditional media cannot or will not do


**Mobile-first:** Innovation driven by how audiences actually access information

# What is Open Source Intelligence?

.pull-left[
## Definition

&gt; "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to address specific intelligence requirements.."
&gt; 
&gt; — Esteban Borges, [RecordedFuture.com](https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-definition)

**For journalism:** Using publicly available information—social media, satellite imagery, public records—to investigate events and hold power accountable.

**Key principle:** Anyone with internet access can verify the claims.
]

.pull-right[
## OSINT sources

- Social media posts (Twitter/X, Facebook, VK, Telegram)
- Satellite/aerial imagery (Google Earth, Planet Labs)
- Public databases and registries
- Flight tracking (Flightradar24)
- Webcams and dashcams
- Leaked documents
- Digital archives

## Why OSINT matters

- Traditional sources blocked or unreliable
- Real-time documentation of events
- Verification of official narratives
- Accountability when authorities fail

# How they did it: The Buk trail

.pull-left[
## Step 1: Initial sightings

- Social media posts showed a Buk missile launcher in Eastern Ukraine
- Videos showed a Buk being transported on a truck
- Posts were geolocated to specific Ukrainian towns

## Step 2: Identifying the Buk

- Close analysis of photos revealed unique markings
- Serial numbers and distinctive features matched
- The same Buk appeared in multiple locations

## Step 3: Tracing its route

- Matched locations from videos to Google Maps
- Used Street View to verify landmarks
- Tracked the Buk from Russia to Ukraine and back

# Practice your OSINT skills!

.pull-left-wide2[
## What are OSINT challenges?

Online games and puzzles that train geolocation, verification, and open-source research skills. Ranging from "where was this photo taken?" to full investigations using satellite imagery, social media, and public records. Many are free and surprisingly addictive.

## My picks

**[WhenTaken](https://whentaken.com)** — Guess where *and when* a photo was taken. You're reading landscape, architecture, clothing, and signage all at once. Free, no account needed, immediately playable.

**[GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com)** — Drops you into Google Street View somewhere in the world. Builds visual intuition for landscape, architecture, and road markings. Free tier is limited but enough to get the idea.

**[Bellingcat Open Source Challenge](https://challenge.bellingcat.com)** — Monthly challenges designed by Bellingcat investigators. Goes well beyond geolocation: ship tracking, satellite imagery, flight data, image verification.
